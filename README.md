What it initally used to be: 
"Trying out some beginner projects
These are some python projects that I'm doing for getting better at learning python. These projects are beginner files from a course I'm doing. Hopefully, I can perform better job in this so that ne day I can make my own projects that can benefit other people."

This repository contains every Python code that I make.
