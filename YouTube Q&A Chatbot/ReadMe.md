# Introduction

This is a very interesting, tricky, confusing, and difficult project which I have decided to work on. A YouTube video Q&A chatbot is a bot that gives answers to the questions asked regarding a video over at YouTube. Look at the "Instructions" section to understand how it works.

## Instructions

To get started, you need to have these libraries and modules downloaded and installed:
- openai.
- faiss-cpu.
- moviepy.
- pytube3.
- langchain.
- tiktoken.
You can install them all through pip:
```
pip install openai faiss-cpu moviepy pytube3 langchain tiktoken
```
You will also need your OpenAI API key to enter it where there's an empty string inside the code:
```
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

### This is an active project and there can be problems that might occur. The program will improve along with my knowledge of AI, Python, and such.
