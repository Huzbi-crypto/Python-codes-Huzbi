# Website Information Lookup Script

## Introduction

I decided to make this project from an inspiration from a repository of <a href="https://github.com/Rehmanareeb/Cobra-cli-IPtrace">Rehmanareeb's</a> that fetches info regarding a website when you enter the URL.\
It was originally made in Go, but I decided to make it in Python since I'm a Python and Javascript guy. It has a different touch with the addition of searching and displaying all social media links it can find.

### Resources Used

This script was made possible with the help of several Python libraries inside VS Code:
  
  - Urllib
  - BeautifulSoup4
  - Requests
  - Sockets
  - Virtualenv
